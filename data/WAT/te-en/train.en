So join us this Friday at 9/8 Central on Intense TV.
Crazy Keith.
You think there might be a connection there?
HAMILTON:
"ho"
This is just like high school.
I'm afraid she's gonna yell at me in that accent that no one understands.
Say your name.
Glad Jack's safe.
Because this farm subjects innocent animals to cruel and sadistic torture.
Well, I just want to...
We find out why, we can start being soldiers again.
You give a lot in relationships.
- (GUN CLICKS)
Get the control case from Zartan.
Yes, you see... I have trouble with my sinuses.
What the fuck are you gonna do with my son?
Doesn't give up, does she?
There's something in here.
Things are about to happen here that may be difficult for many of you to process.
What are you doing out of ranks?
He cannot remember.
Let me finish this first.
You always thought you were right...
Grandma, help us!
It's about other issues I need to resolve.
Show it to the crowd and that whole deal.
It is locked in a cage.
And I shall lead the other squad... on the left flank.
Get that elevator open now!
I didn't recognize you.
Well, you're pretty good at it.
I don't know where that's coming from.
So far, the perimeter's been set.
Gangway! Run, friend!
Shells!
I'll see you around.
Yeah, bullshit.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
You know what I'm talking about.
Where are you going with this?
Really.
I see you've arranged transportation.
Like a tooth.
Zach--
Really?
Rush delivery.
I'm giving you $100.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
You really were hungry.
These past few years must have been pretty hard on you.
That's that's me.
- GARDNER'S BEEN.
And I wonder if you see me when you look at her.
It's overlooked.
That's exactly why he won't open up.
- DUKE: I owe you one, Mouse.
You have routinely put us in harm's way every time!
- Ugh, that was the trick we could never crack.
Hi, Jane.
It's your pretty, shiny Penny.
Kill!
It is your heart that shakes.
I became a Joe to serve.
Kill.
(VACUUM STOPS)
I was involved in a car accident last year.
- Adios.
Their mama shoulda taught them better.
- Too - Wee-bee-dee-bee-dee-boo
I need Dettol and a sticking plaster. No thanks.
It ain't natural.
Now, don't start that again!
The hell, you say.
- Gun clicked.
( breathing heavily )
Get this, right?
Let's see.
It's best we leave now.
Fuck those guys you know what I mean, fuck them.
That is nothing compared to...
( birds squawking )
Why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?
Because...
Till now
At McDonough Elementary? Yes.
And take a glance at the fancy ants
( thudding continues )
Just a gasket.
- l'm not leaving you behind.
We can run away.
We 'bout to go live!
And so treatment begins.
Why you stop shooting?
This is Victor.
It's all right.
Leave me alone.
I have the package.
He used to be a friend.
Feel it?
I tried.
And it's what?
No more televised executions.
Sorry. Whoo. Nice job, Cher.
When you find out you can live without it and go along not thinkin' about it
And I saw her...
Not a single drop of blood.
The Golden Shears.
That's who gave me the job.
But for that...
Does he make love to you better than me?
Fear of the unknown.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Poor woman.
Living in the past-- that's what's wrong with these bloody farmers.
Seriously, what if I say too much?
- I think I love y'all.
How do these work again?
It was your flabby ass.
That's my primo cactus juice!
I don't want to be one of those people that reminds you.
That's the good news.
I wake up and I still have the painting.
- Need a little color here.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Please, say something.
Get the fuck out!
He's a unique asset.
WE CAN BE THERE IN 15 MINUTES.
I told you before, I'm not in that business.
I'm John...
Ain't got no kind of manners.
She pops up here and there without some reason.
Make him look like Eddie Van Halen.
It's so good to see your face.
- - Trust me, quick. -
Not in the sense that you mean, Dominic.
Now the next voice you hear-- will be Simon's.
I just want to do better.
I'm kind of new in town.
It's... one of us.
- Real stupid?
This is Clark.
So, what you said on the phone.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
Keep it up, two, three, four
No, I'm gonna take you somewhere nice and fancy.
He was my best friend.
That's all I ask.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
I know I...
No, you're not up on current affairs, ma'am.
No offense.
I'm your mother.
Yes, Akela?
Free cable for life.
- We'll do what's best for the boy.
Nobody wants us around either.
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.
Any pick-ups?
We have a Joe on the premises.
One catch, though.
- Oh, no! It's Baloo.
[CROWD GASPS]
I can't be bothered with that.
A delivery came.
Package is on the move.
And we were in jail.
Bring your ass back here.
Oh, I left my drill.
It's not that easy.
Talk like you do
I never figured you for a Joe.
I'll tell you a story.
I got your note.
- Well, a-ha ha ha
Leave the world behind you.
This isn't supposed to happen.
Enough with the coffee.
"Hangman."
I need you around.

Like an animal.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Mama, hold on now.
Pretty name.
He does still do it that way.
Are you listening to me?
Maybe the even the shroud itself, everything.
Forbes, what are you doing?
Oh, Paulie.
I can show you.
You don't.
You keep your mouth shut!
Mr. Marvelton, this may be a bad idea.
Come up.
- ( shears buzzing )
Check it.
We're gonna try cardboard cones next.
OI, DON'T BE MAD.
No, no, no...
All right?
Hey, Deanne, happy anniversary.
Was a 3-day wait just to get your shirts pressed.
I'm glad those bankers got shot.
